## Hello there!

You seem to be lost, how did you find this place ? Anyway, welcome
to my personal webpage, there is little content currenly well probably there 
won't be much content in the future but you never know, but feel free to look
around.

You can call me n00bady. When I'm not busy contemplating the profound mysteries 
of lazyingness I like tinkering and learning about technology. Also these days 
I am learning GO and working in a couple of project that I will soonâ„¢ post about them.

Well don't expect to see this blog or this site to be updated regularly. It operates 
in it's own unique schedule, much like my internal clock that seems to be permantly
stuck on snooze. If and when I updated expect to posts about personal projects or 
rambling nonsense.

You might be asking now, why did I start this webpage if I do not intent to 
fill it with content? Well I just though it would be cool to make a personal 
webpage and blog and I wanted to try a little bit of webdev.

Now about this webpage, I build it using HUGO and I used the [ficurinia](https://gitlab.com/gabmus/hugo-ficurinia) theme as 
a base to create something more ["cyberpunky"](https://gitlab.com/n00bady/hugo-ficurinia). I hope you like it although it still
needs some more work.

Thanks for visiting my site if for some reason you need to contact me check the 
[about](https://n00bady.xyz/about/) page.
