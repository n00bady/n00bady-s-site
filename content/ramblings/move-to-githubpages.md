## New year and the move to githubpages

Happy new year I guess, I didn't even touch this blog in 2023 maybe this year I will find
the motivation to write some posts. Probably not...

So with the new new year I decided to stop paying for a VPS I barely use and host this site on githubpages.
If I need to try or test something that requires a VPS I'll just spin up and pay for it when needed instead 
of wasting money on it hosting a webpage nobody uses, not even me.

Well let's hope this year gonna be better than the last one.
